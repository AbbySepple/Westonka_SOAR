# MEAN Stack Google Authentication
An update to the "Easy Node Authentication:Google" tutorial on [scotch.io]("https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-google"). Uses the file/app structure most commonly used by Prime students and makes use of the Express Router module for routing.

# Customization
1. Make a copy of the `auth.template.js`  and rename to `auth.js`. NOTE: Do not include this file in your git repo.
2. Update the new file with your Google API credentials.
